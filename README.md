## Systems Genetic Network AnaLysis (SYGNAL) pipeline
We developed the SYstems Genetic Network AnaLysis (SYGNAL) pipeline to integrate correlative, causal and mechanistic inference approaches into a unified framework that systematically infers the causal flow of information from mutations to TFs and miRNAs to perturbed gene expression patterns across patients.
